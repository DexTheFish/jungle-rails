<!-- 
The admin dashboard page is currently just a place holder, providing no value to admins.

Replace the text on the dashboard page with these general stats about the store:

Display a count of how many products are in the database
Display a count of how many categories are in the database

Make it look nice with Bootstrap 5.
Link to the product admin list/index pages when displaying the counts.
